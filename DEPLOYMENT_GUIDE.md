## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Build Fails - "Module not found"
**Solution**: Make sure all dependencies are in package.json
```powershell
npm install
```

### Issue 2: API Key Error
**Solution**: 
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add `GROQ_API_KEY` with your actual key
3. Redeploy by going to Deployments ‚Üí Click "..." ‚Üí "Redeploy"

### Issue 3: 404 on Routes
**Solution**: Vercel should auto-detect Next.js. If not:
1. Add `vercel.json` (already exists in your project)
2. Make sure it contains proper routing configuration

### Issue 4: Environment Variables Not Working
**Solution**:
1. Check variable names are EXACT (case-sensitive)
2. Redeploy after adding variables
3. Client-side variables must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`

### Issue 5: Slow Loading
**Solution**: This is normal for first load (cold start). Subsequent loads will be faster.
